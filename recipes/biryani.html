    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the plain greek yoghurt, turmeric, chilli powder and salt in a bowl. Put the chicken thighs into the mixture and keep aside for about half an hour. Saffron should also be left to soak in milk for a while. </li>
        <li>Put a deep frying pan on heat and pour the refined oil. Fry the cumin seeds and green cardamom for about 120 seconds. Add the chopped onions into the pan until they turn golden brown add the sliced tomato and the tomato puree and fry for five minutes.</li>>
        <li>Under low heat, add the marinated chicken into the pot and let them mix for a while for the juices to be absorbed into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cover the lid and let it simmer. However, keep stirring to avoid the chicken sticking at the bottom or getting burnt. Add some water if you want less viscous soup. This is done under medium heat for about 6 minutes. Turn off the heat</li>
        <li>Take the pre-boiled bisamati rice and place half of it in a pan. Sprinkle the milk soaked in saffron, gram masala, coriander and mint. The remaining quantity of rice should be layerd on top and garnish with the same ingredients.</li>
        <li>Put on the heat - medium and let is simmer for 5 minutes then put out the flame. This should be done while the pot is covered with a lid. For about 10 minutes after putting the flame off, let the biryani stay covered. Serve thereafter while hot</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
